This is a simple simulation of ATM. I created this application in order to learn and practice Python programming language. Cash Dictionary contains banknote denominations and their amount in the ATM. One needs to enter the amount they want to withdraw. The app checks if the chosen amount and denominations are available in the ATM. The limit for individual user can be set in order to unable the withdrawal of the amount of money exceeding the set sum.
